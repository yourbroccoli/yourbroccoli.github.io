We would love to hear from you.  I know everybody says that, but we're
serious.  We're here to learn, and that involves hearing tips about
resources that'd be useful, getting feedback about waffly writing, or
simply hearing that we resonated with someone.

You can send an email to **paul or caitlin at exsaasperated dot com**,
if you'd like to get in touch privately.  We like email!  We're not
super good at social media unfortunately.  Most posts should also have
a comments section below them, too.

There's also our **mailing list** -- [it'd be great if you joined
that][mailchimp].  We won't be spamming or selling to you, just
sending you updates on new blog posts.
