    If you want to start a business it's pretty difficult to get noticed and
    find users if you're not putting yourself out there, but how does one do that
    without feeling awkward?

Self-promotion feels really awkward to me. I barely post on my personal social media
accounts and I struggle to talk up the things I've done, even to friends and family. In
the past I've managed social media accounts for organisations with large followings, but
when it's my own work or under my own name, it feels different. Needless to say, having
[this blog with my name and photo on it sitting on the front page of Hacker News the other
day](https://news.ycombinator.com/front?day=2020-07-10) was kind of nerve-wracking!

If you want to start a business, it's pretty difficult to get noticed and find customers
if you're not putting yourself out there. As we've made our first efforts to promote the
things we've built, I always feel drawn to the least obtrusive ways of doing that, like
paid search ads targeting people who are already looking for similar services.  Clearly,
this is not a great approach -- the way to do it seems to be joining Facebook groups,
spamming people on Twitter, and the like.

I also wonder if our privacy-consciousness and lack of a social media presence leaves us
at a disadvantage -- would it be easier to launch something and get feedback if we had
thousands of Twitter followers to share it with?

I'd like to get better at being less of a lurker and talking up our efforts, but I want
to do this in a way that feels authentic. I don't want to be one of those people
trumpeting themselves as a 'thought leader' online, or bothering potential customers
by obnoxiously cold-calling them with a sales pitch.

I'd be interested to hear from online business owners who struggle with this too. Have
you managed to overcome it?  Do potential customers maybe not mind as much as I would,
being called up with a sales pitch?
